Group 8 Checkers Game

The design goal for this project is to create a program that is able to play and defeat a human player in a game of Checkers. This would be accomplished using either a minimax, monte carlo, or self-learning artificial intelligence algorithm. Since this would be a board game, the GUI would focus on allowing the player to interact with the board to make their moves. 

The design process of making a board game AI for this project can be split into two main parts. Firstly, a game engine will have to be designed that allows a user to play the game through a Graphical User Interface. This game engine will be built so that it only allows legal moves in the game. The second part of the design process will involve developing a method for the computer to choose what moves to make in the game, the so called “Artificial Intelligence” aspect. During the design process, the aesthetics and range of options (eg: undo, hints, etc…) for the game engine will be kept in mind, however, the priority for this project will be to focus on developing the best possible board game AI.
